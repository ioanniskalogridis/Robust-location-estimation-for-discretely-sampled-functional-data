# Robust-location-estimation-for-discretely-sampled-functional-data
Functions implementing the functional location estimators from Kalogridis, I., and Van Aelst, S. (2021) Robust optimal estimation of location from discretely sampled functional data. Implementation is through the B-spline representation and iteratively reweighted least-squares while model selection is through GCV.
