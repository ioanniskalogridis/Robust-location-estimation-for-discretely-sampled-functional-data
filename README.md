# Robust-location-estimation-for-discretely-sampled-functional-data
Functions implementing the functional location estimators of Kalogridis and Van Aelst (2021).
Implementation is through the B-spline representation and iteratively reweighted least-squares.
Additional scripts reproduce the simulations and real-data example of the paper.
